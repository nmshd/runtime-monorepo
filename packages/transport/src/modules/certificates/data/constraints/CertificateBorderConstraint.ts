/**
 * A CertificateBorderConstraint specifies a state, a country or a union in which
 * this certificate should be valid.
 *
 * This constraint is primarily telling any verifier, that the issuer of the certificate does not
 * hold the eligibility to issue a certificate anywhere else. Thus, the certificate should be
 * treated as not valid outside the specified border.
 *
 * However, showing a certificate which is valid within a certain country (e.g. Germany) might be
 * much better than not having a certificate at all. Therefore, the verifier could still treat this
 * certificate as valid, although the issuer is no longer taking liability.
 *
 * Examples:
 *  - Freight papers for the EU
 *  - Access rights to buildings of the UN
 *  - German driver license
